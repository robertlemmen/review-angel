# Review Angel

## Goal

I would like to write a short, free book on code reviews, with a hippie or
human-oriented perspective: that it is not first about quality gates and
approval, but about collaboration and communication. Quality is the windfall
profit.

## Ideas

- logo: some sort of speech bubble, as in the "comment" icon, with cute comic
  wings. black outlines, white background, one more light, blueish-greenish 
  highlight or shadow. so that it is easy to recognize, works on a book cover,
  works on white background and can be printed as a sticker easily
- title: "Review Angel" short and with a camelia-like childishness 
- subtitle: something along the "as if people mattered" idea, to clarify the
  position in that dimension
- publish as free pdf, perhaps as an ebook for kindle et al, check out
  self-publishing / print-on-demand options. 
- a nice size would be e.g. like the o'reilly uml booklet, A5 or so and about
  100 pages
- get stickers for laptops and beer fridges. show you care!
- encourage readers to review the book itself
- tool and language agnostic, examples in the book should be from different
  languages
- one part for the reviewer, one part for the code author
- write some perl thing to render a code review example
